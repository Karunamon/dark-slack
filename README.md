# dark-slack

A combination of CSS with a few updates to theme out all of Slack matching macOS Mojave's dark mode. We also use local CSS files so you don't have to worry about downloading and the security issues that opens up

# Install

## First

This theme changes the font, it's feels easier to read. You can install from https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lato

If you're running macOS, run install-macos.sh. Otherwise, proceed manually:

Copy the CSS into place, on macOS.

```
cp caiceA.css dark.css /Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources

And then patch ssb-interop.js

```
cat ssb-interop-patch.js >> /Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/ssb-interop.js
```

## Third
